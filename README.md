# Typescript Beginner Project - To Do List
A todo list made with Typescript, scaffolded with Vite. Original project made by [Dave Gray](https://github.com/gitdagray). 

## Project Focus
The focus of this project is to practice Typescript fundamentals by utilizing them in creating a todo list, via a [tutorial by Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61v23Ce5SXA&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6NS8GXt5nPrcYpust89zq_b)

Instead of completely coding along each step of the project, I followed the instructor's instructions by first self implementing each project requirement, then compared my code versus the instructor's code. 

## Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Typescript (Vanilla)
- Vite
